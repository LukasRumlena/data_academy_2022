Question 3: Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (lowest percentage increase year-on-year)?
Answer: sugar, which has been declining in price, is the slowest growing food item year-on-year. Probably due to the abolition of quotas for its production in 2017.

Question 4: Is there any year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (greater than 10%)?
Answer:
The largest year-on-year increase is in 2017-2018 at 8.42%. The answer is no.

Question five: Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if GDP rises more significantly in one year, does that translate into a more significant rise in food prices or wages in the same or subsequent year?
Answer:
According to available data, tax growth is underpinned by slower growth in consumption. Instead, wage growth is not moderate to tax growth.
